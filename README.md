**Predicting Mortality in Heart Failure Patients**

This project aimed to predict mortality in heart failure patients using routinely collected clinical and laboratory data. Using the UCI Heart Failure Clinical Records dataset (299 patients, mean follow-up 130 days), we applied Kaplan-Meier survival analysis and multivariate Cox proportional hazards modeling to evaluate time-to-death. Significant predictors of mortality included age, reduced ejection fraction, elevated serum creatinine, low serum sodium, and a history of hypertension. The final model showed good discrimination (C-index ≈ 0.703) and calibration, illustrating that a small set of easily obtainable clinical variables can meaningfully stratify risk. This work highlights the potential for simplified prognostic tools to support clinical decision-making, particularly in low-resource healthcare environments.
